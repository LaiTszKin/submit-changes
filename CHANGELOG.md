## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- Added an explicit dependency contract requiring `edge-case-test-fixer` then `code-simplifier` for code-affecting releases.

- Reordered the submit workflow to run dependency checks before version/changelog/readme/agent document updates.

### Changed

- Added explicit guidance to infer and share a preferred semver bump before user confirmation.
