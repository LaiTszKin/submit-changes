# README Writing

Update README only when it contradicts the code changes.

Check and update as needed:
- Overview and feature list
- Installation and setup steps
- Usage examples and CLI commands
- Configuration or environment variables
- API or integration instructions

Keep edits minimal and consistent with the existing style.
