# Semantic Versioning

Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for release versions.

- MAJOR: incompatible or breaking changes.
- MINOR: backward-compatible new features.
- PATCH: backward-compatible bug fixes.

Pre-release or build metadata (for example, 1.2.3-rc.1) is allowed only if the repo already uses it.
Prefer the existing tag format and prefix (v1.2.3 vs 1.2.3).

If the change type is ambiguous, choose the lower bump and ask the user to confirm.
