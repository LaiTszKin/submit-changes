# Branch Naming Instructions

Use a short, descriptive branch name in this pattern:

- type/short-description
- type/issue-id-short-description (if issue ids are used)

Guidelines:
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens only.
- Align type with commit message types (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test).
- Do not rename the current branch unless the user explicitly asks.

Examples:
- feat/add-rpc-timeouts
- fix/1234-parse-registry
